"""
Given an array nums of size n and an integer k, find the length of the longest sub-array that sums to k. If no such sub-array exists, return 0.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 7, 1, 9], k = 15  
Output: 4  
Explanation: The longest sub-array with a sum equal to 15 is [5, 2, 7, 1], which has a length of 4. 
             This sub-array starts at index 1 and ends at index 4, and the sum of its elements (5 + 2 + 7 + 1) equals 15. Therefore, the length of this sub-array is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-3, 2, 1], k = 6  
Output: 0  
Explanation: There is no sub-array in the array that sums to 6. Therefore, the output is 0.
